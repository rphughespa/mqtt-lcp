#### MQTT-LCP Application

# MQTT-RAILCOM

This application is reads RAILCOM message published on a Loconet bus and translates
them to MQTT-LCP messages.

Specically, the lnet mesages are generated by a Digikeijs DR5088RC Railcom detector.

There are four basic message of interest:

    * Block Occupied
    * Block Clear
    * Loco entered block
    * Loco has left block

The two block messages are translated into MQTT-LCP "Block" messages. The two loco messages are
translated into MQTT-LCP "Locator" messages.

The programs interfaces to the lnet bus via a serial USB connections to a RR-Cirkits LocoBuffer USB device.

Note:

A full lnet bus is not needed to use this program.  The DR5088RC devices can be run on a standaloce lnet bus.
Simply, the standalone bus consists of a RR-Cirkits LocoBuffer on one end of the bus, the DR5088RC modules in the middle, and a RR-Cirkits SSB Gateway at the other end to provide bus power and termination.

Note:

Some logic in this aplication is based on information published by Digitrax in their 
Personal Edition specification.  

Therefore, use of this code in restricted by Digitrax licenses.
