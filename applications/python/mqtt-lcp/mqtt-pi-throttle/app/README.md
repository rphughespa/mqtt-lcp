#### MQTT-LCP Application

# MQTT-PI-THROTTLE

This application provides an MQTT based touch screen throttle.  The application
is designed to operate on the PI 7" touch screen but should run well on screens
that is at least 800x400.

Each instance of the program presents two independant "CABS" which allows for the
operation of two locos(or consists).  Multiple instances of the program can be run
simultaneously on one computer or across multiple computers to control more locos.
