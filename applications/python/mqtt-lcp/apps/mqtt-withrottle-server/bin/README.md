#### MQTT-LCP Application

# MQTT-WITHROTTLE-SERVER

The WITHROTTLE-SERVER is designed to allow throttle apps that use the WITHROTTLE protocol to interact with the MQTT-LCP layout.

The application translates withrottle protocols messages to/from MQTT-LCP messages.

The WiThrottle IPhone app or the Engine Driver Android app
have been sucessfully tested.
